CrytoTool respects the people behind the screen. It's a four-in-one file manager, gallery, music player, and document viewer built on a simple, radical idea: no tracking, no ads, no data collection. Using a 100% client-side architecture and strong, modern end-to-end encryption, your data is always protected.

The application and backups are secured with **AES-GCM**, derived from your master password. For individual file encryption, you have the flexibility to choose from a suite of elite algorithms:

*   **AES-GCM** & **AES-CTR**
*   **XChaCha20-Poly1305**
*   **ChaCha20-Poly1305**
*   **Salsa20-Poly1305**

Your files are protected and never leave your device.

CrytoTool is compliant with the protocol and respects all the principles included in it: [protocol-3305](https://github.com/ObscuritySecurity/protocol-3305)

### Key Features

## Advanced Security & Privacy

*   **Robust Master Password**: Enforces a strong, 30-character minimum master password to secure the entire application.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Add an extra layer of security to your login using any standard TOTP authenticator app.
*   **Brute-Force Protection**: The login screen features progressive lockout, while the optional Self-Destruct mechanism can be configured to wipe all app data after a set number of incorrect password attempts.
*   **Critical Settings Password**: An optional, secondary password to protect the Settings page from unauthorized changes.
*   **Secure Data Shredder**: When enabled, permanently overwrites data on deletion to make it unrecoverable.
*   **Encryption Key Vault**: Securely save and manage your file encryption keys in a separate, PIN-protected vault, featuring progressive lockout and a blacklist of common, weak PINs.
*   **Elite Encryption Suite**: Encrypt individual files with your choice of modern algorithms: **AES-GCM**, **AES-CTR**, **XChaCha20-Poly1305**, **ChaCha20-Poly1305**, and **Salsa20-Poly1305**.
*   **Timed One-Time Keys**: Generate temporary, time-limited keys to grant secure, short-term decryption access to a specific file.

### Advanced Access Recovery
*   **Offline-First Recovery**: Regain access to your account without needing an internet connection.
*   **Recovery Codes**: Generate a set of 10 single-use codes to reset your Master Password in an emergency.
*   **Reset Token**: Create a unique, persistent token for password recovery, which can be regenerated at any time.

### File Management & Organization
*   **Complete File Operations**: Securely browse, select, copy, move, rename, download, and delete your files and folders.
*   **Dedicated Views**: Instantly access your media with dedicated sections for your **Gallery**, **Music** library, and **Documents**.
*   **Smart Special Folders**: Quick access to the **Vault**, **Backup & Restore**, and your **Journal** directly from the root directory.
*   **Advanced Search**: Instantly find files and folders by name or by custom-colored tags.
*   **Storage Management**: Visualize your on-device storage usage with a clear breakdown by file category.
*   **Smart Trash**: Deleted files are moved to a trash bin for 30 days before permanent deletion, giving you a safety net to recover them.
*   **AI Assistant**: Ask questions and get help about the app's features and security principles.

### Deep Customization
*   **Global Accent Color**: Personalize the entire application's look and feel with a custom accent color, selectable from a full-spectrum color picker.
*   **Multilingual Support**: Choose from over 20 interface languages.
*   **Advanced Folder & File Customization**:
    *   Set a unique background color for any folder.
    *   Choose from over 1,300 built-in icons or upload your own custom image to represent a file or folder.
    *   Organize with custom-colored tags.
*   **View Options**: Choose to hide file and folder names globally for a cleaner, icon-only interface.
