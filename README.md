# CrytoTool:Welcome to CrytoTool, your personal digital fortress. This guide covers all the app's functionalities in detail to help you maximize your security and take full control of your data.## Chapter 1: Our PhilosophyCrytoTool is built on a set of non-negotiable principles:* **Zero-Knowledge:** We, the developers, do not and will never have access to your password, keys or data. The architecture of the application makes this technically impossible.* **Zero-Trust:** The app doesn't trust any external networks or servers. Everything happens on your device, under your control.* **Offline-First:** Basic functionality does not require an internet connection. This drastically reduces the risk of online attacks and ensures access to your data anywhere, anytime.* **Default Security:** The most secure settings are enabled by default. You don't have to be an expert to stay protected.* **Full Transparency (Open Source):** The source code is open to the public for auditing. We believe that real security has nothing to hide.* **No Data Collection:** We do not collect telemetry, usage data, or analytics. Your activity is strictly private.---## Chapter 2: First Steps - Master PasswordThe Master Password is the master key to your entire digital vault. It encrypts everything from your files to your saved encryption keys.### 2.1. Creating the Master PasswordWhen you first start the application, you will be asked to create a Master Password. This must meet the following strict criteria to ensure maximum security:* **Length:** Minimum 30 characters.* **Complexity:** Must contain at least:    * A lowercase letter (`az`)    * A capital letter (`AZ`)    * A digit (`0-9`)    * A special character (e.g. `!@#$%^&amp;*()`)**RECOMMENDATION:** Use a "passphrase" - a sequence of 4-6 random words (e.g. `horse-correct-battery-stapler`). It's easier to remember and exponentially harder to crack than traditional passwords.> **VITAL WARNING:** If you forget your Master Password, your data is **UNRECOVERABLE**. Due to the Zero-Knowledge design, we cannot reset or recover your password for you. Make sure to keep it in an extremely secure place.### 2.2. AuthenticationEach time you open the application, you will need to enter the Master Password to decrypt and access the data.---## Chapter 3: Main Interface - File BrowserOnce authenticated, you will arrive in the file browser, the command center of CrytoTool.### 3.1. Structure* **Top Navigation Bar:** Contains buttons for adding files and folders, and shortcuts to the **Storage**, **Search**, **Trash**, and **Settings** pages.* **Breadcrumbs (File Path):** Displays the current location in the folder structure, allowing quick navigation to a higher level.* **Content Area:** Displays files and folders in the current location as cards.### 3.2. Special FoldersIn the root directory you will find some special, locked folders:* **Vault:** A shortcut to the page where saved encryption keys are managed. Access to this page requires entering your **Vault PIN**.* **Backup:** A shortcut to the Backup &amp; Restore functionality, where you can create or restore a backup of your entire vault.### 3.3. Basic Actions* **Add File/Folder:** Use the buttons in the top bar to upload files from your device or create new folders.* **Navigation:** Click on a folder to enter it. Use breadcrumbs to get back.---## Chapter 4: Security in Detail### 4.1. File Encryption* **Process:** Any (unencrypted) file can be encrypted. Click on a file's menu (the three dots) and select `Encrypt`.* **Algorithm Selection:** You can choose between several modern and secure encryption algorithms:    * **AES-GCM / AES-CTR:** The global standard, used by governments for classified data. Offers excellent, hardware-accelerated performance.    * **XChaCha20-Poly1305 / ChaCha20-Poly1305:** Extremely fast stream ciphers, ideal for software encryption and large files.    * **Salsa20-Poly1305:** A respected predecessor of ChaCha20, known for its robust security profile.* **Key Generation:** For each operation, a unique, strong, and cryptographically random encryption key is generated.* **Save to Vault:** You have the option to save this key to **Key Vault**, associating it with a category (e.g. "Documents", "Pictures") for easy retrieval. **This step is highly recommended.**### 4.2. Decrypting Files* **Process:** Click on the menu of an encrypted file (`.enc`) and select `Decrypt`.* **Enter Key:** You will need to enter the exact key that was used to encrypt the file. You can copy it from the Vault or from the safe place where you saved it manually.* **Temporary Keys (If active):** If a temporary key was generated for the file, you will need to enter that secret token, in addition to the master key, in order to decrypt.### 4.3. Key Vault and PIN* **Purpose:** The vault is a secure place to store all of your file encryption keys.* **PIN Protection:** Access to the Vault is protected by a **6-digit PIN**, separate from the Master Password. This PIN must be set the first time you access the Vault.* **Temporary Lockout:** After several failed attempts to enter the PIN, access to the Vault will be temporarily blocked, with a progressively increasing waiting time, to prevent brute-force attacks.* **Warning:** If you forget your Vault PIN, **all keys stored in it are permanently lost**. There is no recovery method.### 4.4. Advanced Security Settings (from the Settings page)* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** You can enable 2FA using any standard authentication app (TOTP). Once enabled, in addition to your Master Password, you will also need to enter a 6-digit code from your app to authenticate.* **Settings Password:** An optional secondary password that blocks access to the Settings page. Useful to prevent unauthorized changes to security configurations. **And it is unrecoverable if you forget it.*** **Self-Destruct:** An extreme security measure. If enabled, after 5 failed attempts to enter the Master Password, a timer starts (e.g. 1 hour, 24 hours). If no successful authentication occurs within this time, **all data in the application will be permanently and irreversibly deleted.*** **Secure Data Shredder:** When you permanently delete a file, this option (if enabled) overwrites the data on the disk multiple times (3 passes) with random data before deletion, making data recovery through forensic methods almost impossible.* **Timed Keys:** When this feature is enabled, you can generate an additional secret token for an already encrypted file. This token has a limited validity period (e.g. 1 hour). To decrypt the file, both the original key and this valid token are required. It is an excellent mechanism for temporarily and securely sharing access to a file.---## Chapter 5: File Management and Personalization### 5.1. Actions on Files/FoldersThe context menu (the three dots) of each item provides access to a series of actions:* **Download:** Downloads a copy of the file to your device. (Not available for folders).* **Copy &amp; Move:** Copy or move an item to another folder in your structure.* **Delete:** Moves the item to the Trash.* **Select:** Activates multi-selection mode to act on multiple elements simultaneously.### 5.2. CustomizeThis option opens a complex dialog where you can change the appearance of a file or folder:* **Rename:** Edits the name of the item.* **Color:** Changes the background color of the card.* **Icon:** Choose from a library of hundreds of icons organized by category or upload your own image (PNG, SVG, etc.) to use as an icon.* **Tags:** Add colorful labels to organize and search your files more easily. You can create new tags with custom names and colors.---## Chapter 6: Applied Modules### 6.1. GalleryThe **Gallery** page is your visual hub.* **Overview:** Displays a grid of all image and video files in your vault.* **Quick Categories:** Quickly navigate between **Pictures**, **Videos**, custom **Albums**, and **Favorites**.* **Media Previewer:** A click on any image or video opens a full-screen player, where you can navigate between items, add to favorites, and view the content in detail.* **Creative Tools:**    * **Collage Maker:** Select 2-9 images to create a collage. You can choose the layout, the space between images, and the roundness of the corners.    * **Image Obfuscator:** Censors portions of an image by pixelating or blurring.    * **Metadata Extractor:** Upload a JPG image to view its EXIF data and download a "clean" version.    * **ASCII Art &amp; Glitch Art:** Turn your photos into generative art.    * **Pixel-Sort Artist:** Creates abstract images by sorting pixels in an image based on their brightness.### 6.2. MusicThe **Music** module turns CrytoTool into a secure audio player.* **Library:** Displays all your audio files, along with sections for **Playlists**, **Albums**, and **Artists**.* **Create Albums/Playlists:** You can create custom albums by specifying the album name, artist, and uploading a cover. Playlists can be created by simply selecting the songs you want.* **Integrated Player:** A click on a song opens a full-screen player, with full functionality: play/pause, song navigation, progress bar and song information.### 6.3. DocumentsA simple and efficient page that lists all your documents (PDF, TXT, etc.) for quick access and preview.---## Chapter 7: Recovery and Maintenance### 7.1. Backup &amp; Restore* **Location:** Accessible through the special "Backup" folder in the root of the files.* **Create Backup:** Generates a single `.cbt` file encrypted with the Master Password. This file contains **absolutely everything** (files, keys, settings). Save it to an external hard drive or cloud service.* **Restore:** Upload a `.cbt` file and enter the corresponding Master Password to completely overwrite the current state of the application with the backup. **Warning: This action is irreversible and will delete all current data.**### 7.2. Account RecoveryIf you forget your Master Password, the only way to recover access is through the methods you have previously prepared in **Settings > Access Recovery**:* **Recovery Codes:** A set of 10 unique, one-time use codes.* **Reset Token:** A single, powerful token that can be configured for single or multiple uses.> **Storing these recovery methods in a safe place, separate from your primary device, is of paramount importance.**### 7.3. Trash* **How it works:** Deleted files are moved here for 30 days.* **Actions:** You can **restore** a file to its original location or **permanently delete** it.* **Automatic Deletion:** After 30 days, files are automatically and permanently deleted.---This guide covers the architecture and functionalities of CrytoTool. By understanding and using these tools correctly, you can ensure an uncompromising level of digital security and privacy.
